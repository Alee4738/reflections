What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
Git creates a .git folder in the directory but doesn't create a commit.
You need to do it to be able to save commits and be able to access them
when debugging.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
 What value do you think it offers?
The staging area takes files from the working directory and puts them into the
repository. It is Git's way of creating a single commit from the files while
still giving you the power to choose which files go into a commit.
