When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When you're working from multiple computers or have a friend collaborating on the same
project.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
 automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
You may be working on your repository, then someone else works on the remote.
If Git automatically syncs your local with the remote, you may not know it, or 
you it may interfere with what you're working on.
